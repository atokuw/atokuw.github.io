                        Alec Toku Whiting is a composer, improviser, and multi-instrumentalist based in Boston, Massachusetts. Primarily a koto player, his improvisatory approach is rooted in his experiences studying modern music for the instrument while growing up in Yokohama, Japan. His technique foregrounds the manipulation of timbre and its relationship to physical gesture. As a composer Alec’s work results from the investigation and synthesis of abstract formal processes and intuitive structures in pursuit of a multiplicitous musical event.
